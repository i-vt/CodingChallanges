# Radix
## Identification
Identifying and solving a radix problem involves recognizing that the problem is about converting numbers between different bases (radix). A radix, or base, is the number of unique digits, including zero, used to represent numbers in a positional numeral system. The most common base is 10, the decimal system, but other bases like binary (base 2), octal (base 8), and hexadecimal (base 16) are also widely used in computing.
Identifying a Radix Problem

- Context: The problem will often involve conversions between numeral systems, e.g., binary to decimal, hexadecimal to binary.
- Keywords: Look for terms like 'base', 'binary', 'decimal', 'hexadecimal', 'octal', 'conversion', or specific base numbers like 2, 8, 10, 16.
- Operations: The task might require arithmetic operations (like addition, subtraction) in a non-decimal base, or questions about representation of numbers in different bases.
## Thought Proocess
Thinking Process for Solving Radix Problems

1. Understand the Bases: Know how different bases work. For example, in base 2, each digit can be 0 or 1, while in base 16, digits can be 0-9 or A-F.
2. Conversion Methodology: For conversion, understand the principles of each base. For example, in base 10, the value 123 represents 1×(10^2)+(2×10^1)+(3×10^0).
3. Algorithmic Approach: Design a step-by-step approach for conversion. This may involve dividing and getting remainders for conversion to a higher base or multiplying and adding for conversion to a lower base.
4. Edge Cases: Consider edge cases, such as very large numbers, non-standard bases, or invalid input formats.

## Sample Python Code for Radix Conversion

This sample code demonstrates how to convert a number from one base to another. It can serve as a boilerplate for solving similar problems.

```
def convert_from_base_to_decimal(number, base):    """Converts a number from a given base to decimal."""
    return int(number, base)

def convert_from_decimal_to_base(number, base):
    """Converts a decimal number to a given base."""
    if number == 0:
        return '0'
    digits = []
    while number:
        digits.append(int(number % base))
        number //= base
    return ''.join(str(d) for d in reversed(digits))

# Example Usage
num = '1011'  # Binary Number
base_from = 2
base_to = 10

# Convert from binary (base 2) to decimal (base 10)
decimal_num = convert_from_base_to_decimal(num, base_from)
print(f"{num} in base {base_from} is {decimal_num} in decimal.")

# Convert from decimal to hexadecimal (base 16)
hex_num = convert_from_decimal_to_base(decimal_num, 16)
print(f"{decimal_num} in decimal is {hex_num} in hexadecimal.")
```

This code includes functions for converting a number from any base to decimal and from decimal to any other base. It demonstrates converting a binary number to decimal and then to hexadecimal. You can modify this code for different bases and conversions as per your specific radix problem.
